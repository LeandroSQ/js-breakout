## About

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Atari Breakout game, originally made by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1976. It was made using Typescript and the HTML5 Canvas API.
For Audio it uses the WEB Audio API, using oscillators to generate the sounds at runtime.

## How to play

Use the `mouse` or `arrow keys` to control the paddle and try to score as many points as possible.
