## About

A hacky but fun project, I challenged myself to achieve the design aesthetic of the Windows 98 version of Minesweeper with PureJS, which apart from the numbers I got pretty close. At the end I replaced the use of a special font for images, which allowed for multiple color schemes.

## How to play

- Left click to reveal a cell
- Right click to flag a cell
- Click on the face button to restart the game
